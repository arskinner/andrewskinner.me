In collaboration with The Economist, we built a content marketing advertising platform called Trigr. The premium ad units became The Economist's most profitable ad product, generating hundreds of millions of impressions for many Fortune 500 brands. Due to The Economist's global appeal, ad units were automatically deployed to worldwide edge locations for <100ms load times.
