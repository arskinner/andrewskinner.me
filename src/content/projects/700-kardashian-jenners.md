In collaboration with Whalerock Industries, we built a content and commerce mobile application framework for the Kardashian-Jenner sisters. Each sister had their own app, featuring lifestyle blogs, video tutorials, and on-demand live streams. At launch, 3/5 of the apps were in the top 50 in the App Store and 10s of millions of viewers tuned in to their live stream on Day 1.
